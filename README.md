Tauhere
1. (verb) (-a) to tie, bind, lash
2. (noun) link, connection, linkage, tie.

Tauhere is a community-building tool that connects Maori with Maori based on shared history.

When attending a hui, all attendees give an introduction; this process is called mihimihi. As part of an individual's mihi, they will give their pepeha. Pepeha is a form of introduction which establishes identity and heritage. This is an important process for Maori, as it allows us to identify connections with one another. There's a really special moment when someone hears another person whakapapa back to the same iwi, same awa...a little light comes on in their eyes, and you can almost hear the "a-ha". It's not necessarily the realisation that they could be looking at a distant relative - while that thought is certainly there, it's just as much about having a common history, a connection. Even if that person isn't some kind of cousin, their ancestors came from the same area, may have known each other, may have lived side-by-side. 

These communities were lost in the post-Second-World-War urbanisation of Maori. While I don't have access to exact figures, I suspect the number of Maori regularly attending hui or any kind of marae event (other than tangi) is relatively low, limiting the number of opportunities to build connections. This is where Tauhere comes in. 

Users can enter the details of their pepeha, set their location (town or city suburb), and be able to see whether other users in their area share common details. Eventually, users will be able to add multiple pepeha to their profile - for example I whakapapa to both Ngapuhi (from my grandfather) and Tainu (on my grandmother's side). Users will be able to set their location using maps, and set a radius for Tauhere to search for other users, sending alerts when there are matches within that user's set radius. With the addition of a messaging feature, it is my hope that users will reach out to one another, and re-establish communities that were once a central part of our identity.
