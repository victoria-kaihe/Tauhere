      <h3>Who are we?</h3>
      <p>There's a special moment, when you're talking to someone and you realise that you share something from your history in common.
        Maybe you went to the same university, maybe you went to kindergarten together. Perhaps your parents worked together at some point. All these little things bring us closer together. I've seen and experienced this moment on marae up and down the country - feeling a moment of recognition, of connection, with another person upon hearing them give their pepeha. Our ancestors travelled here together. Lived near each other, maybe knew each other. We are from the same place. We are many and we are one.
      </p>
      <p>These are the connections that Tauherea aims to help people make. We don't all have the same oportunities to regularly attend hui, to return to our turangawaewae...but most of us have a smartphone. By creating a profile and entering your pepeha details (as many as you know), Tauherea will find other users near you who share pepeha details in common with you. Eventually it will utilise a messaging platform to help M&amacr;ori fully bridge that gap, form communities, and connect more with our identities as M&amacr;ori.
